# FoodCast
College dining halls and small to medium scale restaurants will buy FoodCast because of the inefficient food demand forecast. 

We are trying to solve the problem of overestimated food demands leading to waste.

Extremely wasteful production of food in dining halls leads to increases in food wastes as food not eaten at the end of the day is thrown away.

Overestimation in food demand leads to significant food waste in dining halls and restaurants, causing unnecessary costs and environmental impact.


College dining halls and small/medium scale restaurants will buy FoodCast to predict food demand accurately reducing food waste collectively.

Using real-time data we will predict food demand (taking into consideration external factors like student exam schedules, football matches, etc) reducing food waste collectively.
